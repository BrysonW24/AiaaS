In a typical GitFlow model, there are two main approaches:
    Create testing branches from develop (which is what the commands show)
    Have a dedicated testing branch that receives merges from develop

    The current workflow in your file shows testing branches being created from develop, but the comment incorrectly says "from testing". 
    This should be corrected to "from develop" to match the actual commands.

For a more structured approach, you could consider:
    1) main (production)
    2) testing (pre-production/QA)
    3) develop (integration)
    4) feature branches (individual development)

A more standard GitFlow approach would be:
    1) Feature branches → develop (integration of new features)
    2) Develop → testing/QA branch (for testing before release)
    3) Testing/QA → main (production-ready code)

This would mean feature branches merge to develop, develop merges to testing for QA, and testing merges to main for production releases.

Standard Git Workflow

Initial Setup (One-time)
# 1. Create or clone repository
    git clone <repository-url>
# OR
    git init
    git remote add origin <repository-url>

# 2. Set up main branches
    git checkout -b main
    git push -u origin main

    git checkout -b testing main
    git push -u origin testing
    
    git checkout -b develop testing
    git push -u origin develop

# 3 Checking status
    git status
    dir
    git pull

---

Feature Development Workflow
    # 1. Create feature branch from develop
        git checkout development
        git pull origin development
        git checkout -b feature/my-feature

    # 2. Create files/folders
        mkdir -p new-folder/subfolder
        touch new-folder/subfolder/new-file.txt

    # 3. Edit files and make changes
    # (Use your editor to modify files)

    # 4. Check status and stage changes
        git status
        git add new-folder/
        git add . # (all files)

    # 5. Commit changes
        git commit -m "Add new feature files"

    # 6. Push feature branch to remote
        git push -u origin feature/my-feature

    # 7. Create pull request (via GitHub/GitLab/etc.)
    # (This is done through the web interface)

    # 8. After review, merge to develop
        git checkout develop
        git pull origin develop
        git merge feature/my-feature
        git push origin develop

    # 9. Delete feature branch after merge
        git branch -d feature/my-feature
        git push origin --delete feature/my-feature

---

Testing/QA Workflow
    # 1. Merge develop into testing branch
        git checkout testing
        git pull origin testing
        git merge develop
        git push origin testing

    # 2. Run tests and make fixes
    # (If issues are found, create fix branches from testing)
        git checkout testing
        git checkout -b fix/test-issue

    # 3. Commit test fixes
        git add .
        git commit -m "Fix test issues"

    # 4. Push fix branch
        git push -u origin fix/test-issue

    # 5. After review, merge fix to testing
        git checkout testing
        git merge fix/test-issue
        git push origin testing

    # 6. Merge testing back to develop to keep it updated
        git checkout develop
        git merge testing
        git push origin develop

---

Release Workflow
    # 1. When testing is complete, create release branch from testing
        git checkout testing
        git pull origin testing
        git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

    # 2. Make final adjustments and version bumps
    # (Update version numbers, etc.)

    # 3. Commit release changes
        git add .
        git commit -m "Prepare release v1.0.0"

    # 4. Merge to main
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        git merge release/v1.0.0
        git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
        git push origin main
        git push origin --tags

    # 5. Merge back to testing and develop
        git checkout testing
        git merge release/v1.0.0
        git push origin testing
        
        git checkout develop
        git merge testing
        git push origin develop

    # 6. Delete release branch
        git branch -d release/v1.0.0
        git push origin --delete release/v1.0.0

---

Hotfix Workflow
    # 1. Create hotfix branch from main
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

    # 2. Make emergency fixes
    # (Fix the critical issue)

    # 3. Commit hotfix
        git add .
        git commit -m "Fix critical issue"

    # 4. Merge to main
        git checkout main
        git merge hotfix/critical-fix
        git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"
        git push origin main
        git push origin --tags

    # 5. Merge to testing and develop
        git checkout testing
        git merge hotfix/critical-fix
        git push origin testing
        
        git checkout develop
        git merge testing
        git push origin develop

    # 6. Delete hotfix branch
        git branch -d hotfix/critical-fix
        git push origin --delete hotfix/critical-fix

This workflow follows the GitFlow branching model, which is widely used for managing development, testing, and production code.
